# Cybersecurity Simulation

## Overview

This cybersecurity simulation is designed exclusively for educational purposes, aiming to train IT professionals in identifying and responding to security breaches effectively. The primary goal of this application is to create a controlled environment where users can practice responding to network security breaches and enhance their cybersecurity skills.

## Features

### Basic Functionality

In its current demonstration state, the simulation provides basic functionality, including:

- **Network Security Breach Simulation**: Users can trigger a network security breach scenario for training purposes.

### Future Development

The application is designed with future expansion in mind. Planned features and enhancements include:

- **Integration of Scapy**: Integration of Scapy to enable more advanced intrusion simulations and network packet analysis.

- **Open-Source IDS/IPS and SIEM Integration**: Plans to integrate open-source Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools such as Snort and Suricata for more realistic and comprehensive security breach simulations.

### Problem-Solving Tasks

To enhance user engagement and skill development, the simulation will include problem-solving tasks that go beyond simple interactions, such as:

- **Configuration of Firewall Rules**: Users will be required to configure firewall rules based on observed traffic patterns, teaching them to adapt to emerging threats.

- **Diagnosing Network Anomalies**: Users will be tasked with diagnosing the causes of network anomalies, promoting analytical thinking and troubleshooting skills.

### IDS/IPS Simulation

If feasible, the simulation aims to integrate basic functionalities of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). Users will have the opportunity to configure and observe the effects of these systems in action, further enhancing their understanding of network security.

### Security Policy Formulation

Users will be encouraged to develop and apply security policies within the simulation. They can adjust their approach based on observed outcomes, fostering an understanding of proactive security measures.

### Interactive Analysis Tools

The simulation will provide interactive analysis tools, including:

- **Log Analysis**: Simulated logs will be provided, challenging users to sift through them to identify signs of intrusion or system malfunctions. This feature encourages the development of critical analytical skills.

- **Network Mapping**: An interactive network map will allow users to visualize the status of various network segments and devices. Understanding network topology and the impact of security measures on different network components will be a key focus.
